				<h1>Early Life Childhood</h1>
				Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on April 16, 1889, in London England into a family of entertainers to Hannah Chaplin and Charles Chaplin Sr. 
				Both of his parents were music hall entertainers. His childhood was marked with poverty and struggle. 
				His parents did not earn much and hence he started to work at a workhouse at the age of seven.
				Chaplin spent his childhood going in and out of the workhouse as well as being educated by a range of charitable schools. 
				In 1898, his mother was admitted to a mental asylum, after she was diagnosed with psychosis. 
				This deeply affected him and his mother remained in care until her death in 1928, leaving the young Charles and his brother Sydney to look after themselves.
				
				<p>
				Having inherited natural talents from their parents, the youngsters took to the stage as the best opportunity for a career. 
				Charlie made his professional debut as a member of a juvenile group called "The Eight Lancashire Lads" and 
				rapidly won popular favour as an outstanding tap dancer.

				<h2>Beginning of his career</h2>
				Charlie Chaplin came to the United States in 1910, at the age of 21.  He was brought to New York, which was known to 
				be a great place to start out for anyone trying to become professional actor.  
				Two years later, in 1913, Chaplin signed his very first contract at Keystone and it was no time before he headed to Hollywood.  
				His first movie premiered in 1914, “Making a Living,” and went on to make over 35 movies total in that year alone.  
				His rise in popularity was like nothing that people had seen, though with parents of fame, it was nothing new to Charlie.
				
				<p>
				Charlie Chaplin grew to become one of the most popular and successful actors of all time.  
				The moment that really kicked off his long career was in 1921 when he starred in, and produced, his first full length 
				film called “The Kid.”  From then on, most people all over the world knew Charlie Chaplin and loved his movies.  
				He had a great career and life, dying on December 25, 1977, in Vevey, Switzerland.  
				He had apparently died of natural causes in his sleep from old age.
